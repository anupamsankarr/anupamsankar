I’m a **SecOps Engineer** deeply committed to strengthening digital defenses and understanding how attacks unfold beneath the surface.  
My approach to cybersecurity is built on **continuous learning, curiosity, and precision** — combining hands-on analysis with a calm, methodical mindset.  

I’ve gained valuable experience working with tools like **Qualys, CrowdStrike, Cylance, SentinelOne, Cloudflare WAF, Heimdal** etc, and I’m currently broadening my expertise across **SIEM management, threat detection, Digital Forensics & Incident Response**.  

Beyond tools, I focus on the discipline of detecting, investigating, and adapting to threats with clarity and purpose.  

> *“Quiet work. Clear vision. Strong defense.”*


## Objective
My journey in cybersecurity began with curiosity.. exploring how systems work, how attacks unfold, and how defenders respond.  
Over time, hands-on experience with **VM, EDR** tools  has shaped my approach: methodical, precise, and focused on learning from every alert and incident.  

Now, I am eager to bring this mindset to a Security Operations Center as a SOC Analyst — detecting threats, investigating incidents, and helping organizations stay one step ahead of adversaries.
